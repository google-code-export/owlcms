#summary Release Notes

== Release 2.3.1 ==
  * Added template for provincial Jeux du Québec games scoring system

== Release 2.3.0 ==
  * Jury and Referee decision displays now highlight which person who has not given decision
  * Jury decision display shows decision as soon as all decisions are in.
  * Checkmark on referee/jury pad is now shown using a character instead of an image; this
    avoids prompt to download image that happened when a ref would leave finger on device.
  * Referee names now shown on start list
  * May now edit referee names and session details from the weigh-in page.

== Release 2.2.3 ==
  * Plate loading information can be tracked from mobile device.
  * Same message for "session done" was being reused inappropriately in the result frame
    title and in the lifting order board; they are now distinct.

== Release 2.2.2 ==
  * Column alignment and cell padding was broken by a recent Vaadin change to the stylesheets. 

== Release 2.2.1 ==
  * Can now choose between 3 styles for main display (bright colors for DLP, darker colors for LCD,
    and a pale setting which is less punchy but works with a wide range of displays)

== Release 2.2.0 ==
  * Added support for 3-person Jury: a dedicated display (iPod) is used for displaying the
    jury decisions.  5-person Jury is doable, but not needed at this time.
  * The referee decisions are now sent as soon as the refereeing device is touched.  Touch devices
    wait 400ms before sending "onClick"; this has been worked around by a custom-built GWT widget
    that triggers on the touchStart event.
  * The *down* signal is emitted by the main computer, to further reduce latency.  This currently means
    that in 2-platform competitions only one can use the computerized refereeing system (though both
    can use the Jury).  Support for the old "in browser" approach will need to be tested again now that
    we have fixed the touchstart issue; otherwise we will need websockets and HTML5 sound to reduce latency.
  * Long names are handled better by the main display.

== Release 2.1.3 ==
