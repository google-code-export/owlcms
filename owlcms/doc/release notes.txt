#summary Release Notes

== Release 2.8.2
  * Fix: Start List report did not show registration category correctly.
  * Fix: Use English template for documents when the template is not available in the native language
  * Fix: using a language other than English or French now sets the application locale to en_US
         (fix in 2.8.1 was incomplete.)
  * Fix: Processing of date in registration template now works as documented in the setup guide.
  * Installation Guide (draft)
  * Competition Setup Guide (draft)
    
== Release 2.8.1
  * Fix: Had inadvertently disabled the down signal while adding support for independent audio
    for multiple platforms in v2.8.0.
  * Read information about the competition from the registration spreadsheet
  * Set the default competition book template when initializing the database.
  * Associate the default sound mixer to the default platform.
  * Assume that by default the system provides timekeeping and decision lights.
  * All error messages now appear according to the language selected by the browser.
  
== Release 2.8.0
  * Tested to work under embedded Tomcat (packaged as a Windows executable)
  * Tested under Ubuntu Linux 11.10 as an embedded Tomcat (packaged as a tar.gz)
    - known issue (minor): the final buzzer sound is emitted, but cut short.
  * Tested under Ubuntu Linux 10 as a server (packaged as a war)
    - under this configuration, sound is likely not available. The sounds are
      generated on the server itself, in order to avoid latency. Ubuntu Server
      does not install pulseaudio, and installing it is not straightforward.
  * Clean-up of sound processing
  * When editing a platform, the sound mixer to be used as output can be selected.  Refresh button
    on the announcer screen will read this setting again. This is useful on computers that have
    several mixers/sound cards, or when two platforms are in use.
  * No longer requires the presence of a serial port (used to drive old-fashioned LED display boards)

== Release 2.7.2
  * Fix: when using multiple platforms, sessions were appearing multiple times in dropdown.
    due to ill-defined hashcode function and use of unnecessary eager fetch.

== Release 2.7.1
  * Fix: notifications to the announcer for good/bad lifts were duplicated if the announcer
    used the menus to go to another page and came back.  General clean-up of registration
    and unregistration for all notifications.
    
== Release 2.7.0
  * All sounds are now produced on the server.  This removes the dependency on Flash running
    in the browser, and increases reliability.  Reminder: there is no user interface
    to select which sound mixer is used for a platform, so sounds can only be used on
    single-platform setups. 
  
== Release 2.6.2
  * Better visual separation for decision lights
  * Article 6.5.15 - exception implemented : two minutes are granted if an athlete just
    lifted, was not called, and changes by other athletes bring him back to lift, even
    if time started for the other athletes.  The athlete gets 1 minute if he was called
    and participated in the sequence of weight changes that brings him back as
    next lifter.
  * Improved feedback to referees using tablets
  * When using tablets, better usability for announcer: if a decision is given by the officials,
    the announcer controls for "lift/no lift" are hidden, preventing the announcer from recording
    a spurious decision.  If on the other hand no decision has been given by one official (due to
    malfunction), and flags are used, the controls are visible and the announcer can record the
    decision.
  * Tested with "Dolphin Mini" browser on Android tablets.  Recommended for use on low-end tablets.
    

== Release 2.6.1
  * Split the clock button into a separate start and stop button, to facilitate cooperation
    between time keeper and announcer, especially when time is stopped for a weight change.
  * Time keeper can use "Enter" key to start and stop timer without using the mouse
  * Simplified interface for timekeeper console.

== Release 2.6.0
  * Reworked the attempt board for better readability
  * When using wireless tablets for decisions, show the decision to the announcer as a notification
    at the top of the screen. Also show decision reversals.
  * Corrected computation of plate loading so that collars are not used with large thin 2.5kg plates
  
  
== Release 2.5.2
  * Made sure that all decision changes are shown consistently on all displays.
  * Preparation work for supporting audible down signal on multiple platforms.

== Release 2.5.1
  * Marshall shown on weigh-in list (which is used as paper backup)
  * Increased separation between buttons on tablets for jury and referees.

== Release 2.5.0
  * Moved LifterCard generation to JXSL package (and Apache POI) to give end users more control 
    on look&feel

== Release 2.4.1
  * Wait until all referee keypads are blocked to register decision.
  
== Release 2.4.0
  * Fixed Lifter-facing display when referees change their decision.

== Releases 2.3.2 to 2.3.7 ==
  * Many team scoring subtleties for provincial "Jeux du Québec" games
  * Work-around for results not being shown immediately when selecting Results page
  * Fix for category display on result board for youth competitions (e.g. >85) -- fixes regression
    introduced by Masters category display.

== Release 2.3.1 ==
  * Added template for provincial "Jeux du Québec" games scoring system

== Release 2.3.0 ==
  * Jury and Referee decision displays now highlight which person who has not given decision
  * Jury decision display shows decision as soon as all decisions are in.
  * Checkmark on referee/jury pad is now shown using a character instead of an image; this
    avoids prompt to download image that happened when a ref would leave finger on device.
  * Referee names now shown on start list
  * May now edit referee names and session details from the weigh-in page.

== Release 2.2.3 ==
  * Plate loading information can be tracked from mobile device.
  * Same message for "session done" was being reused inappropriately in the result frame
    title and in the lifting order board; they are now distinct.

== Release 2.2.2 ==
  * Column alignment and cell padding was broken by a recent Vaadin change to the stylesheets. 

== Release 2.2.1 ==
  * Can now choose between 3 styles for main display (bright colors for DLP, darker colors for LCD,
    and a pale setting which is less punchy but works with a wide range of displays)

== Release 2.2.0 ==
  * Added support for 3-person Jury: a dedicated display (iPod) is used for displaying the
    jury decisions.  5-person Jury is doable, but not needed at this time.
  * The referee decisions are now sent as soon as the refereeing device is touched.  Touch devices
    wait 400ms before sending "onClick"; this has been worked around by a custom-built GWT widget
    that triggers on the touchStart event.
  * The *down* signal is emitted by the main computer, to further reduce latency.  This currently means
    that in 2-platform competitions only one can use the computerized refereeing system (though both
    can use the Jury).  Support for the old "in browser" approach will need to be tested again now that
    we have fixed the touchstart issue; otherwise we will need websockets and HTML5 sound to reduce latency.
  * Long names are handled better by the main display.

== Release 2.1.3 ==

  * Public Message button added to all consoles, including Results.
  * Results pane now correctly shows the selected group on first invocation and through URL fragment.

  * (1.8.5-a) Fixed default communication port for NEC display.
  * Location of team templates moved to a team sub-directory, only name shown in dropdown
  * Restored Points and Ranking button on results page (fixed regression introduced in 1.8.2)
  * Fix for obscure bug with 2-minute rule that only showed up if announcer acts as timekeeper ("start time on announce" option).
  * Clean-up of push behavior so that the push() method is not called involuntarily in constructors.
